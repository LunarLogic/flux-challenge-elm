A solution to [flux-challenge](https://github.com/staltz/flux-challenge) written in Elm.

## Starting the app

The app is started automatically by Glitch. Click "Show" at the top and then
either open the app in a new window or next to the code.

If you see an error about the app failing to start, try making a small change in `package.json`,
like adding a trailing space to one of the scripts or something. It triggers reinstallation of the
whole project and usually helps. This is a Glitch related problem.
